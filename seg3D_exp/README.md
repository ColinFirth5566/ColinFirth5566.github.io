# Seg3D Viewer

Minimal static viewer for Seg3D outputs. Run Seg3D in Python, export `.glb`, and open it here.

## Files
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `app.js`

## Usage
1. Run your Seg3D pipeline to generate a `.glb` file.
2. Open the site and select the `.glb` file.
3. Orbit/zoom/pan to inspect the mesh.

## Notes
- This site is fully static; no backend calls.
- `.glb` is recommended for a single-file asset.
